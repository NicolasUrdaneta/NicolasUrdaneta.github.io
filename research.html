            <p class="content">What determines the distribution of establishments in terms of size and life-cycle growth? How are those determinants related to aggregate productivity? We provide novel answers by developing a framework that uses price and quantity information on establishments' outputs and inputs to jointly estimate the demand and production parameters, and subsequently establishments' quality-adjusted productivity, deriving both micro-level and aggregate implications. We find that the dominant source of variation in establishment size is variation in quality/product appeal but that variation in technical efficiency plays an important supporting role. Multiple factors dampen dispersion in establishment size including dispersion in input (quality-adjusted) prices, markups, and residual wedges. Relatively moderate dampening factors induce large aggregate allocative efficiency losses relative to their absence. We show that joint estimation of the parameters of the demand and production function crucially affects inferences on the determinants of the size distribution of firms and their implications for aggregate productivity.

                <p class="content">The relationship between businesses and inequality has been a focus of recent attention globally.
                This chapter summarizes basic facts about this relationship in Latin America. Unlike advanced economies where superstar firm growth has prompted concerns over disproportionate income growth at the top, the facts we summarize illustrate that the main concern for Latin America is the extreme prevalence of tiny businesses whose workers and owners tend to populate the bottom income segments. The empirical likelihood that these businesses improve their productivity and grow to hire more workers and pay better wages is also very low. The region displays a deficit of employment generation in small and medium enterprises, by contrast to both micro businesses (including self-employment) and large corporations. While the former tend to remunerate both workers and owners with very low incomes, the latter pay high wages but exhibit low labor shares.

            <p class="content">This paper examines the effects of tariffs along the supply chain using product-level data from a large U.S. wine importer in the context of the 2019-2021 U.S. tariffs on European wines. By combining confidential transaction prices with foreign suppliers and U.S. distributors as well as retail prices, we trace price impacts along the supply chain, from foreign producers to U.S. consumers. Although pass-through at the border was incomplete, our estimates indicate that U.S. consumers paid more than the government received in tariff revenue, because domestic markups amplified downstream price effects. The dollar margins per bottle for the importer contracted, but expanded for distributors/retailers. Price effects emerge gradually along the chain, taking roughly one year to materialize at the retail level. Additionally, we find evidence of tariff engineering by the wine industry to avoid duties, leading to composition-driven biases in unit values in standard trade statistics.

            <p class="content">We document systematic differences in business size distributions between less developed countries (LDCs) and richer economies using employment and household survey data from 51 countries. The elasticity of average business size to per capita GDP is larger than previous estimates based on firm-level data. In LDCs, non-employers and micro-establishments (NEMEs) dominate employment- Non-employers sit at the bottom of the income distribution followed by wage workers, though overlaps exist. NEMEs nearly fully account for informality and workers who earn below the poverty line. We evaluate macro-development models and conclude that those that best explain low income and high inequality in LDCs incorporate constrained occupational choice, dual technologies, and informality as a size-correlated distortion. Bringing individual-level data into the analysis is crucial to adequately account for the thick bottom of the business-size and productivity distributions in poorer economies.

            <p class="content">How should gender discrimination and systemic disadvantage be addressed when more discriminatory and less generous students systematically sort into certain fields, courses, and instructors' sections? In this paper, we estimate measures of gender bias and evaluation generosity at the student level by examining the gap between how a student rates male and female instructors, controlling for professor fixed effects. Accounting for measurement error, we find significant variation in gender bias and generosity across students. Furthermore, we uncover that bias varies systematically by gender and field of study and that patterns of sorting are sufficiently large to place female faculty at a substantive disadvantage in some fields and male faculty at a disadvantage in others. Finally, we document that sexist attitudes are predictive of gender-based sorting and propose Empirical Bayes inspired measures of student-level bias to correct for instructor-specific advantages and disadvantages caused by sorting.

            <p class="content">This paper studies gender biases in the student
            evaluations of teaching at a university in Colombia. I use a linear
            regression with student fixed effects that account for grades and
            professor skills, measured with a value-added model, to determine that,
            on average, full-time female professors receive evaluations lower by
            0.07 standard deviations than male professors. Meanwhile, there are no
            gender differences among adjunct professors or teacher assistants.
            However, there is significant heterogeneity. In courses with 35 to 55
            year-old professors, with more than 50 students, or with a smaller share
            of female students, female professors are discriminated against the
            most. In such cases, biases have a magnitude of about 0.1-0.2 standard
            deviations and represent 40\% of all evaluations. Additionally, women
            are mostly described with words related to personal characteristics
            ("kind" or "comprehensive"), and men are associated with course-related
            topics or positive adjectives ("topic", "exam", "talented"). Based on
            the results found, I propose several possible measures to reduce student
            bias and allow analysis on the evaluations to consider the gender
            differences.
